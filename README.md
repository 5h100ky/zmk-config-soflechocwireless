Sofle Choc Wireles
--------------------------
My Sofle Choc Wireless Split Keyboard

The Sofle Choc Wireless was designed by db, and is closely based on the Sofle Choc (wired) by Brian Low, which was based on the excellent Sofle RGB by Dane Evans, which was based on the original Sofle v2 by Josef Adamčík.
